  <h3 class="main_text">Hi!</h3><br/>
  <p class="main_text">I have several hobbies outside of studying.<br/>
  I am a videographer. I love creating visual content.<br/>
  I am a traveller. I love to explore.<br/>
  I am a dancer. I love to perform.<br/></p><br/>

  <p class="main_text aboutme_text">I have many passions outside of studying. While I enjoy
    learning and expanding my knowledge, I also want to live my life to the fullest,
    which involves doing things I love. I believe in living every moment to the
    fullest, and really appreciating the world around me. All the people I have
    had the chance to converse with, all the places I have been to, all the
    things I've seen, heard, and done.</p><br/>

  <p class="main_text">Below are some photos of my travels, my experiences, and
    my life. In fact, many images are screenshots of videos that I have made over
    the years. I believe in preserving every experience, and while photos capture a
    snapshot, videos capture the moment.</p>
