  <p>I am a developer. I love to build projects. This is one of the first practical
    projects that I built during one of my classes my sophomore year. This is
    a mobile weather application that fetches real-time weather data and
    displays it. One feature that I always wanted in a weather application was
    a simple way to compare today's weather with yesterday's, or tomorrow's
    weather with today's. Often times, reading just numbers in celsius or
    fahrenheit does not tell you much.</p>

    <p>This is another application that I built over the summer. This is a very
      basic real-time chatting application that uses Google's Firebase console.
      This application, although very simple, taught me a lot about making network
      requests and learning how to manage databases at a simple level. It also
      helped me gain a stronger understanding of laying out content and other
      Swift fundamentals.
