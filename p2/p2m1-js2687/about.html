  <p class="information">Ithaca's premier event of the Fall, Apple Harvest
    Festival is a three day celebration of food, fun, and apples!

    The 35th Annual Great Downtown Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival by Presented
    Tompkins Trust Company is set to take place September 29 - October 1, 2017.
    The 2017 Apple Harvest Festival hosts plenty of apples, local produce, fresh
    baked goods, family entertainment at every turn, games, rides, prizes and
    live performances on two stages. Apple Harvest Festival is a great introduction
    to the rich farm and artist community of Ithaca.  First time visitors can
    witness a variety of wonderful local entertainment while also visiting the
    historical outdoor pedestrian shopping mall, The Ithaca Commons.
    The pedestrian mall is the epicenter of the festival and the gateway to a
    nostalgic journey to harvest season fun.
