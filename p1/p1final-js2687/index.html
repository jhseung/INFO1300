    <h3>Hi, welcome to my site. </h3>
    <p class="align_right">I am Ji Hwan Seung, a current junior undergraduate at Cornell University.
      I am majoring in Information Science with concentrations in data science and
      networks &amp; markets. I love to cook, workout, and dance during my free
      time. </p>

    <p class="align_left">I come from an international background. I have lived in California for
      two years, Japan for four, and Connecticut for four. I was born in Korea,
      but most of my education was done abroad. Living in different places has
      allowed me to meet people from many different backgrounds.</p>

  <div class="main_text">
    <p class="align_right">The past five years have been life changing. I was accepted into Cornell
      in the spring of 2013, and first came to campus in the fall of the same
      year. After a long year of difficulties and hardships, I took a leave of
      absence to serve my conscription duty back in South Korea. After completing
      my military service by the fall of 2016, I travelled Europe, visiting France,
      England, Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, experiencing cultures and building
      relationships with new people. I learned to play golf, I made working out
      a habit, and I began to cook for myself. Five years is a long time, and the
      past five years have transformed who I am.</p>
