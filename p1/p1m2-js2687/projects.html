  <p>I am a developer. I love to build projects. This is one of first practical
    projects that I built during one of my classes my sophomore year. This is
    a mobile weather application that fetches real-time weather data and
    displays it. One feature that I always wanted in a weather application was
    a simple way to compare today's weather with yesterday's, or tomorrow's
    weather with today's. Often times, reading just numbers in celsius or
    fahrenheit does not tell you much.</p>
